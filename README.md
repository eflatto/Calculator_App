I am currently learning full stack web development with node and express.

These are the steps I took to start a new project.

1. mkdir new folder
2. create .js file
3. set up a new NPM package using the command - ``` $ npm init ```
4. make the entry point the (.js) file
5. install express using the command - ``` $ npm install express```
